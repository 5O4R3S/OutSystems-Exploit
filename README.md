# OutSystems-Exploit
OutSystems Exploit or Out-Exploit is a tool developed in Python that encompasses a set of modules that allow you to perform analyzes or explorations in applications developed in OutSystems in the Reactive and Mobile frameworks.

Important: Only run this tool in environments where you are authorized, we are not responsible for the misuse of this tool and the responsibility for its use lies entirely with the professional running it.

Objective: The main focus of this tool is to enable security professionals and those passionate about OutSystems to carry out some basic tests of possible vulnerabilities in their OutSystems applications, so that they can issue a report and correct their applications, delivering a safer and more mature product to the customer Final.

This tool is developed in my spare time, so updates may take time to be released.
